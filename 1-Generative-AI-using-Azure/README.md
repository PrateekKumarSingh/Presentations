## GPT

GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a language model that can generate human-like text. It is trained on a large corpus of text data and uses a transformer architecture to understand context and predict the next word or sequence of words.


### Generative

The term "generative" refers to the ability of the model to create new and original content. In the case of GPT, it can generate human-like text by predicting the next word or sequence of words based on the context provided.

### Pre-trained

"Pre-trained" means that the model has undergone an initial training phase using a large dataset before being fine-tuned for specific tasks. In the case of GPT, it is initially trained on a vast corpus of text data to learn the statistical properties and patterns of human language.

### Transformer

A "transformer" is a specific type of neural network architecture designed to process sequential data efficiently. Transformers utilize attention mechanisms to capture relationships between different elements of the input sequence, enabling them to understand context and dependencies effectively. GPT is built upon the transformer architecture.


## Azure OpenAI

Azure OpenAI Service gives customers advanced language AI with OpenAI GPT-3, Codex, and DALL-E models with the security and enterprise promise of Azure. Azure OpenAI co-develops the APIs with OpenAI, ensuring compatibility and a smooth transition from one to the other.

With Azure OpenAI Service, customers get the security capabilities of Microsoft Azure while running the same models as OpenAI. Azure OpenAI Service offers private networking, regional availability, and responsible AI content filtering.

### Important Concepts and Terminologies

#### Models

The service provides users access to several different models. Each model provides a different capability and price point.

GPT-4 models are the latest available models. These models are currently in preview. For access, existing Azure OpenAI Service customers can apply by filling out this form.

The GPT-3 base models are known as Davinci, Curie, Babbage, and Ada in decreasing order of capability and increasing order of speed.

The Codex series of models is a descendant of GPT-3 and has been trained on both natural language and code to power natural language to code use cases. Learn more about each model on our models concept page.

The following table describes model families currently available in Azure OpenAI Service. Not all models are available in all regions currently. Please refer to the capability table at the bottom for a full breakdown.

|Model family|Description|
|-|-|
|GPT-4|A set of models that improve on GPT-3.5 and can understand as well as generate natural language and code. These models are currently in preview.|
|GPT-3|A series of models that can understand and generate natural language. This includes the new ChatGPT model (preview).|
|Codex|A series of models that can understand and generate code, including translating natural language to code.|
|Embeddings|A set of models that can understand and use embeddings. An embedding is a special format of data representation that can be easily utilized by machine learning models and algorithms. The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Currently, we offer three families of Embeddings models for different functionalities: similarity, text search, and code search.|
